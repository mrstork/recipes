- 2 egg yolks
- Juice of 1 lemon
- 2 cloves of garlic, crushed
- 2 teaspoons of dijon mustard
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- ~ 1 1/2 cups of grapeseed oil (or any neutral oil)

1. Place the yolks, lemon, garlic, salt, and mustard in a bowl. With a hand blender combine the ingredients.
2. Continue to blend everything and slowly pour in the oil little by little with a thin stream. Once the mixture is thick and spoonable, it is time to stop adding oil.
