- 1 tablespoons white peppercorns (whole)
- 1 cup fresh dill, roughly chopped (1 big bunch)
- 250g rock salt
- 250g white sugar
- 1 kg salmon, sashimi-grade, bones removed and skin on

1. In a bowl, combine sugar, salt, peppercorns, and dill until evenly distributed.
2. Lay out out a piece of plastic wrap and spread about a third of the curing mixture in the middle of the wrap. Place the salmon, skin side down, on top of the mixture, then spread the rest of the mixture on the top and sides.
3. Wrap tightly and place in a container. Add a weight on top of the salmon that evenly distributes pressure.
4. Refrigerate for 12 hours. Flip, then refigerate another 12 hours.
5. Scrape and rinse the salmon, pat dry with paper towel, then place in the fridge uncovered to dry for a final 3 hours.
