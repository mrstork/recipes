title: "Tomato Soup"
---

- Tomatoes, usually beefsteak
- Red onion
- Olive oil
- Salt
- Pepper
- ~500ml Mushroom stock

1. Half and core the tomatoes, half the onions. Place on a roasting tray with a drizzle of oil and a sprinkle of salt and pepper.
2. Roast at 400Â°F until onions are nicely carmelized.
3. Remove the skins from the tomatoes, and get everything into a pot. Add the stock and cook down until the flavours have combined. Can use a hand blender if you'd like a smooth soup.

Note: You can add any vegetables you'd like to the roasting tray. Try carrots, peppers, and squash.
