---

- 1/2 cup yellow mustard seeds
- 1/2 cup brown mustard seeds
- 1 1/2 cups of vinegar
- 1 teaspoon of salt

After fermenting:

- 1/8 cup of brown sugar
- 1/8 cup of light beer

1. Place the mustard seeds, vinegar, and salt in a glass jar. Cover with cheesecloth, and let it sit out of direct sunlight for 2-3 days.
2. Dissolve the sugar in the beer over a gentle heat.
3. Pour some of the mustard seed mixture into the beer solution. With a hand blender, break down the seeds, add more mustard seeds and repeat. Do this until you have a thick mixture where some of the mustards seeds are still in tact, while the rest have been broken up.
