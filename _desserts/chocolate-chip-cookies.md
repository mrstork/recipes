- 1 cup (227g) unsalted butter
- 2 tablespoons (28g) milk or heavy cream
- 2 cups (260g) all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons (6g) kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon (6g) baking soda
- 1 1/2 cups (300g) sugar, ideally half/half brown and white
- 2 large eggs (3.5 oz / 100g), cold from the refrigerator 
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- 300g - 400g dark chocolate, coarsely chopped

1. Brown the butter, add milk/cream to help it cool down and to reintegrate some of the evaporated water content.
2. Once cooled, combine the butter mixture with the sugar. Add the egg and vanilla, mix until uniformly combined.
3. Sift in the dry ingredients and add the toppings, mix until just together.
4. Scoop onto a tray, cover so they don't dry out, and cool overnight in the fridge. You can also pop these into the freezer once they've firmed up, to keep them for longer.
5. Bake for roughly 12 minutes at 350Â°F, leaving to cool on the baking sheet once pulled out. Baking times will vary if baking from frozen. I recommend a smaller batch initially to figure out the timing. You're looking for a slightly darker foot that allows you to push the cookie on the tray slightly and it stays together.

Note: This recipe is very flexible once you have gotten the base recipe down. I have made it successfully with just one type of sugar, it easily handles more or less chocolate, and I've even replaced the chocolate with mini eggs. I've also successfully turned this recipe into a white chocolate and dried cranberry cookie, as well as a matcha white chocolate cookie. It seems that as long as you maintain the correct butter/sugar/egg/flour ratio, you have a lot of wiggle room, so get creative!
