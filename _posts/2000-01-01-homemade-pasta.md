- 1 egg
- 3/4 cup flour
- Pinch of salt
- 1/2 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil

1. Place the flour in a bowl and make a well in the middle.
2. Add the rest of the ingredients to the well. Use a fork to whisk and slowly incorporate the flour into the mixture to prevent lumps from forming.
3. Once the dough is shaggy, tip the contents of the bowl onto the counter and begin kneading until smooth. If you're having difficulty incorporating all the flour, put a tiny bit of water on your hands and continue kneading.
4. Cover the dough and rest for at least 30 minutes, it should soften up significantly.
5. Roll the dough out into a narrow strip to fit the width of the pasta attachment.
	- Run the dough twice, once on each side, at the highest thickness.
	- Fold the ends of the dough towards the center, and then in half (like a book). Run this through the attachment at the highest setting again, once on each side.
	- Continue running the dough, decreasing the setting on the attachment each time, until you reach the desired thickness.
	- Cut the dough with the desired pasta shape attachment. Make sure the pasta is the desired length before cutting it at this stage.
6. Boil until cooked to your liking.
