title: "Banana Bread"
---

- 2 ripe bananas, mashed until smooth
- 2 eggs
- 3/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1/2 cup butter, melted and cooled
- 1 1/2 cup flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

1. Add the eggs and the sugar to a bowl, whisk well. Add in the vanilla and banana, whisk until uniform. Pour in the butter, whisk until uniform.
2. Sift in the dry ingredients, mix until just combined.
3. Line a loaf pan with parchment paper, and pour in the mixture. Sprinkle a bit of sugar on top if you want to add a crunchy texture.
4. Bake at 350Â°F for about 50 minutes, until a toothpick pulls out clean.

Note: This recipe works well with flour mixes, try 1 cup AP flour and 1/2 cup almond flour. It also works well with butter substitions, try vegan butter or coconut oil.
