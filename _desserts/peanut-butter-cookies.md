title: "Peanut Butter Cookies"
---

- 500g peanut butter
- 175g sugar
- 2 eggs, lightly beaten
- 10 ml vanilla

1. Add the sugar and peanut butter to a bowl, mix well. Pour in the eggs and vanilla, mix until uniform. The mixture should thicken up quite a bit at this point.
2. Using a 1 1/2 tablespoon scoop, scoop the cookies onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. With a fork, create a criss cross pattern on top of the cookies. You can dip the fork in sugar to help prevent sticking.
3. Bake at 350Â°F for about 10 minutes, or until a foot forms.
